# GCD-on-bash

In this script we find GCD integers number.  
Algorithm work this program next:  

``` bash 

./GCD.sh
Enter first and second variable 25 5  
GCD is 5 # Here the answer
# And then, program not off. They will be off, if enter not valid data.

```

! When enter, first and second variable need separated space
